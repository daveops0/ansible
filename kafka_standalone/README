This playbook will create a standalone Kafka node

Anything that needs updated is located in vars/main.yml

There is test script which runs at the end to test the node is working as expected.

If successful, you will see this on your Ansible output:
ok: [IP] => {
    "testscript.stdout": "Creating test topic.....\nCreated topic mytesttopic.\n\n
    Describe test topic.....\nTopic: mytesttopic\tPartitionCount: 1\tReplicationFactor: 1\tConfigs: segment.bytes=1073741824\n\tTopic: mytesttopic\tPartition: 0\tLeader: 0\tReplicas: 0\tIsr: 0\n\n
    Produce test message into topic.....\n>>\n
    Consume test message from topic.....\nThis is a test message on mytesttopic\n\n
    Congrats! If you got this far without errors, your standalone Kafka node is good to go!"
}

Also included some helpful scripts in your Kafka user's home to create, describe and list topics.
NOTE: Kafka user should be NON-ROOT so if it is ever compromised the system cannot be damaged
